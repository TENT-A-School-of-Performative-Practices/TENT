## What is it?

> It is a TENT, in a physical object and a school as an idea. It is a
> yearly programmed school, which works with 4 participants each year.
> The school creates the right[^1] condition and support structures for
> the artist to work and learn. The school doesn\'t have its own
> property, but works with other institutions and their resources.
> Basically for a year programme, the school works with 10 institutions,
> on month residency at each place. So the participants of the school
> will move together and work at different institutions/cities in our
> programme. We will be working with spaces and institutions which can
> host all 4 participants together. The food, shelter, studio to work
> are taken care of by the school and it's partner institutions. The
> participants receive monthly scholarships as well.
>
> TENT is both our school as well as our manifesto. In the time where
> schools/institutions use doors and walls to safeguard themselves from
> outsiders. We feel that having outside interactions is oxygen for us.
> That is why we do not have walls and use our floor of the TENT as a
> site for a collective manifesto written by POC artists. Coming from
> the political culture of Indian Universities(ex JNU Delhi, AUD Delhi
> etc), I feel that the walls and floors of an institution is the site
> for mutual exchange, understanding each other\'s politics and
> representing our thoughts, which one can not put in the academic
> books. It is also a space to write, especially for the people, who do
> not feel included or belonging into the current artistic institutions.
> It should also be a place to showcase our solidarity, on the ongoing
> struggles across the world. It is who we are and what we stand for.
>
> In the past in India, I have been part of institutions, where there
> were no doors. Even outside people were allowed to come in, eat
> affordable food, share thoughts, and interact with the participants.
> These informal interactions are important to be connected to the
> public reality. The current European art institutions miss this space.
> The best way to start towards it is by opening the doors at our
> school/institution. TENT does not have any doors, and that is why it
> is an object as well as manifest our stand on accessibility.

## How are the participants selected?

> The curator of the school with a small board decides the four
> participants each year rather than inviting applications via open call
> or anything. We believe that open calls are close calls[^2]. The
> school will invite three non-European artists from difficult
> circumstances[^3] and one European artist.
>
> Reaching a potential candidate involves a few ways.

-   Word of mouth

-   By actually dedicated travelling to outside of European countries

-   Getting local partners in the other countries

-   Other artists nominating for the procedure

> While we follow these methodologies to reach the larger potential
> participants. We will go through some kind of selection procedure. A
> week-long residential workshop, to finalise the final participants.
> Where the last 10 invited participants/artists will participate. The
> board and curator of the school, choose the four participants for that
> year. We feel that this process will include positioning of the
> person, the condition of the person, who needs it more at that moment
> and why that person needs to get in. The school will find ways to make
> sure that these residential artists are somehow connected with the
> school for the programme, even if they do not become the four for the
> year. So the school will try to make this connection with the
> participants.
>
> While the school can only accommodate four participants per year,
> there are programmes within the school structures where other people
> can join in various ways. While we want to have those programmes and
> also the school and its activities *accessible*, we can not claim that
> it is for everyone.

## Why should other institutions support it?

> We believe that the current institutions have tried hard to make
> things work. They had a good intention to build a better society, as
> we do not feel very much represented by these institutions. We want to
> build our own. It's not a fight, it\'s a negotiation. They can exist,
> we can also exist. For us, it is worth trying out and see if we can
> have something more inclusive. It is not the best, but a space of
> tryout. Current institutions and people running it with values of
> inclusion, diversity, and democracy, have not learned how to do it?
> And that is why these structures are very violent in terms of
> emotional, mental and sometimes even physical aggression. While the
> current institutions are not able to create the right conditions,
> we[^4] as artists/curators are open to take the responsibility of
> doing it. And the values are shared by all of us.
>
> Institutions should also support it, because it will create a new way
> of thinking, a platform and structure for artists/works/cultures,
> which wouldn\'t have reached to this field, so a kind of cultural
> diversity[^5] and a newness in the field, to support creating
> prototypes of hopes and new networking. The participants of the school
> will also share their practices and experiences of sustaining in the
> art despite the difficult situation. These are valuable knowledge and
> hope for the european institution and the city of the institution,
> that is also something which the institutions can learn from this
> framework. All those institutions should support it, who ask, 'Can we
> be your ally? If yes then in what forms?". This is an experiment which
> all the institutions want in themselves, but don\'t have the courage
> to do, so now when we as school are doing that, it is not just that
> they should support, but it\'s their responsibility to do so.
>
> Artistic and educational institutions should support the TENT, because
> it offers a concrete opportunity of being allied with people/artists
> that they state that they want to include, but do not have the tools,
> capacities, expertise or institutional willingness(despite the
> individual willingness) to include. TENT being open, without doors and
> being in public also addresses the people who would not feel
> represented or invited in artistic institutions. The current european
> art institutions, being so elite and having strong walls and heavy
> doors, are inaccessible to the people. Collaborating with TENT, they
> can create this connection again.

## How does it work? What happens/practices at the school?

> The participants of the school live together[^6], eat together, have
> conversations and create together[^7]. At the time, where as art
> institutions we are claiming to become a community, the market , its
> structure and the neoliberal world is producing highly individual art
> and artists to enhance the potential for profit with disregard to
> creative merit. In these frameworks, this school actually wants to
> work with the idea of collectivity and would want to explore what this
> can produce? There will be no classes as such, but each institution,
> when the participants arrive, are encouraged to propose a walk to the
> city and locations, with which the participants should interact. The
> school has twice a month dinners/lunches with the city and its people.
> These launches/dinners will be cooked by the participants. These are
> public moments, not in a performative sense, but eating together as a
> gesture and to get to know people, and the city around. These are
> important practices and moments of the school. There will also be at
> least two moments, where the participants are encouraged to go out in
> the city, mostly to know the city, understand it, and maybe to work
> with it in performative-non performative manners. The school also
> works with a couple of artists/curators and invites them to the school
> for a few weeks during the year. These artists/curators don\'t come to
> teach, but to share their own practices and experiences.
>
> While the school believes in collectivity and collective creation as
> practice, there are also two moments for one month each, where the
> participants get individual time. In this individual time, each
> participant works independently, at one institution/residency. The
> participants always have a support structure by a body that consists
> of a collective of 3-5 artists/curators/thinkers. This collective body
> changes each year. The curatorial team of the school decided this
> body, with support of existing structures, collaborators and artist
> community. There is also some involvement of the previous year
> participant in deciding this collective body. Each year at least one
> participant from the previous year becomes part of this collective
> body.

## What does it do/produce?

> The first and foremost thing is to create the right condition[^8] for
> the artists, who are not participating in the art world in the
> traditional ways[^9]. These artists are innovating ways, structures
> and systems, to create, sustain, develop and practice. So in a way, to
> date, they are creating/finding their own paths. These artists are
> from a working-class background, where they can't participate in the
> *art world,* in the traditional way at all, and can never reach here.
> It gives exposure as well as learning in an international setting. The
> learning here is in two ways, while these artists are getting exposure
> to the European, institutional art world, these artists are also
> coming with their knowledge of *innovation* and finding their *own
> paths*. Just the sharing of that can be very fruitful and enriching to
> the European institutions, artists and community. *TENT also* tries to
> create a space of learning with each other in a practical setting and
> sense. A kind of collaboration and cooperation. It shall also create
> an example of possibilities, that it is not hard to find the right
> way. It works within the structures without any accountability to the
> authorities.
>
> While working with institutions and structures, I heard a lot about
> accountability. I also heard the restrictions, because of the
> accountability. Mostly a Director of an institution or the art
> manager, always says that he/she/they want to do things in this way,
> but some other authority is above them, who is not letting them
> decide. At TENT, we are the ones, who are, who can and who will be
> deciding. So it is a kind of prototyping institution. It is also a way
> to find ways of working with the institution, without following the
> structures. It is not revolutionary, it is negotiatory.

## How is it a school?

> A question about how it is school and not a residency comes always
> when you first look at this project. We want to make it clear that
> this is a school and not a residency. The first reason is that this is
> the kind of school ***we*** wanted when we came here for our
> learnings/exposures or other things and joined this programme. So
> basically redefining school, or expanding on what a school can be? The
> second thing is, we believe that culture is a living practice, and art
> and living practices are not very far. In that case, this school
> creates these cultural interventions within the framework of school
> structure to change or reshape it. When one goes to a residency,
> he/she/they don\'t feel ownership of it, rather a commodified relation
> is established and it\'s a space of production, while in school you
> feel ownership and a kind of familial relation. This is why it is
> important for us.
>
> This is also school because school is a place of learning and peer to
> peer learning, exposure to new institutions and their working
> conditions, exposure to the art world of different countries,
> conversations by the invited guest and people you meet at the dinner
> tables, are the practical learning, which the participants are
> getting. *TENT* itself wants to be a *learning subject* and develop
> according to what it can learn while doing it. Thus TENT is a space of
> learning through culture, which has been built via living practices.

## How does it come and where does it exist?

> At the moment we are busy with structures and creating conditions.
> It\'s in real structure and real conditions as well as metaphorical
> structures and conditions for art and artists, to see art education,
> artists\' spaces and residencies in a different way.
>
> Working in the structure I see that while the art managers and
> institution directors are responsible for someone, the artist doesn\'t
> have the same responsibility towards THE Structure; rather they are
> accountable or responsible for the director of the institution or the
> art manager. In this sense, there is a space to play, and create
> temporary structures as artists, with the art managers and directors
> of the institution within the framework of art, not with the framework
> of the institution. There is a need to change and revolt and as the
> current leaders can\'t do it individually as they are already so much
> into the bureaucracy, what they can do is to let us in and support our
> practice to create parallel structures, which can be freer, more
> independent and can take more politically engaged decisions. It is
> also a need in the context of working at the moment, without following
> the rules of neoliberal structures and the world. It\'s a space of try
> out, which we all need, and as an artist-curator, we want to take this
> risk and see possibilities.

## Where are we at this moment?

> At this moment, we only have concrete support from two institutions.
> Both the institutions agreed to provide a one-month residency as well
> as a basic salary to the artists. These institutions also agreed to
> provide studios and workspaces. I am planning to take the coming year
> to connect various institutions, to see the possibilities of
> collaboration and shared resources. The school will not be central
> eurocentric. I imagine it to travel to central Europe, eastern Europe
> as well as at least one Asian continent. We will propose to the
> central European institutions to support more resource-wise so that we
> can also work at eastern European institutions just by having their
> residency support. One thing is clear, that if I will not be able to
> find the right structure and support, I will not invite the said
> number of participants. We will only invite participants if we as a
> school can create the right condition for them to come.
>
> I see Banyan as a metaphor for this school and structure. Banyan is a
> tree, in Hindi, it's called, 'Bargad', its roots go very deep into the
> earth. It also has a quality, that its seeds go around on its own and
> sometimes it even goes into big old structures/buildings, grows in it
> and even destroys these structures. At the moment, as an
> artist/curator, this is my metaphor. I am using a tent, as Banyan.
> This tent keeps transforming and reshaping its image with certain
> issues, politics and realities, which is a non-European
> artist/curator, I/we are dealing with.

[^1]: Food, shelter, studio, basic salary, peer support, collective
    expert support, peers to share nonproductive time with, ownership
    and sense of belonging, to hoost outsiders

[^2]: Usually the open call is not for everyone, sometimes it already
    selects the artist whom it wants to work with, also the open call
    reaches in a circle and never goes out of it. It\'s all about who is
    accessible to which institutions?

[^3]: Class is an important aspect in the frame of difficult
    circumstances, while other kinds of marginalisation is considered,
    but class is an important one.

[^4]: \'we' consist of people of colour, with experience, from different
    socioeconomic backgrounds, realities

[^5]: Most of the non-eu artists who reached the EU are the privileged
    classes of their country. Europe still could not have reached the
    marginalised section of artists from other reality. The profile of
    the artists selected to TENT, are one who can never join art from
    the normal methodology. They always struggle and try to create and
    form their own ways to sustain in the art field. Even listening to
    those stories and experiences can be very fruitful and hopeful for
    the art community of Europe.

[^6]: In the same apartment, not in the same room

[^7]: Collective work as well as individual work with each others
    support

[^8]: Food, shelter, basic resources, studio, basic salary, technical
    equipments, theatre, local collaborators

[^9]: Lower class background, do not go to professional art school,
    because of class position, are not accepted by the mainstream art
    market in their countries
